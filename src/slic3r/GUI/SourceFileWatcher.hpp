// about Model/ModelVolume, Plater, or what "reload" means -- the caller supplies the set of
// resolved paths to watch and a callback to run once a change is confirmed.
//
// Two watches cover each other's blind spot: most exporters write a temp file and rename it into
// place (only visible as a directory-listing change), while an in-place overwrite produces no
// directory event at all and needs a watch on the file itself. The event handler doesn't try to
// match the reported path -- macOS's kqueue backend can report a rename with just the directory
// and no filename -- it only wakes a debounced stamp comparison against the baseline recorded in
// set_watched_files(). Per-file watches are skipped on Windows: wx's MSW backend rejects them
// with an error dialog, and its ReadDirectoryChangesW directory watch already reports in-place
// writes.
